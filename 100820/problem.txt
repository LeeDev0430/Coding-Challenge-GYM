Summary:
The positions of gems within the rectangle are given.
Find the maximum number of gems that can be passed from the bottom edge of the rectangle to the top edge of the rectangle.
Here we are given left and right upper bound vectors of the direction we can go.

Editorial:
We can solve this problem using affine transformations and sets.
Let's apply the affine transformation to the original gems in the coordinate system with the left and right quadrant vectors as two-order vectors.
Then, if the direction vector is between the left and right upper bound vectors, it means that both the x and y coordinates are non-decreasing since it is a transformed coordinate system.
This is equivalent to the problem of finding the largest non-decreasing permutation of an array of y-coordinates given the points in order of non-decreasing x-coordinates.
This algorithm is a classical algorithm and is easily solved using sets.
The time complexity is O(n * log(n)).
