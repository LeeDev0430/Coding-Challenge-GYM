Summary:
Given two sets A and B containing n match values in a plane.
You can catch one match value at a time and move it parallel.
Find the minimum number of operations required to make group A the same shape as group B.

Editorial:
This problem can be solved using normal geometry and data structures.
Use vector decapsulation and map data structure.
When group A is made to have the same shape as group B, the deviation is constant for each corresponding match value.
Therefore, the match values that did not move at this time are match values whose deviation from the corresponding match values in meeting B is the same as the above deviation.
Among the deviations of each match value pair in A and B, the frequency of the deviation with the highest frequency is the maximum number of match value pairs that do not need to be moved.
Therefore, at least match values excluding non-moving match values should be moved.
The time complexity is O(n * n * log(n)).
