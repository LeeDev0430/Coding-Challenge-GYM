Summary:
This is similar to the classic missing bracket finding problem.
Matching pairs of bracket are obtained by taking a stack, pushing the bracket on the stack when it starts, and popping the bracket off the stack when the bracket ends.
Just in this problem, since given a Json string, think of using bracket in the form of {} and "" instead of parentheses ().
