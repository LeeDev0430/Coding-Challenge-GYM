Contest: 100091, problem: Problem D. Color Wizards


Summary:
A tree with roots is given.
For u and v as a question, find the length of the path from the root to the least common ancestor of u and v.

Editorial:
This problem is a typical least common ancestor problem.
Depth first search can be used to find the depth of each node.
The least common ancestor is the first node with the deepest depth that is the same depth and above every node.
Using preprocessing, for every node, the node 2^i above this node can be obtained.
Then, the k-th ancestor of each node can be calculated log times.
Therefore, since the depth of each node is known and the k-th ancestor of each node is known, the least common ancestor of any two nodes can be calculated in log times.
Time complexity is O(N * log(N)).
