Contest: 100118, problem: Task C. Strengthening bridges

Summary:
Given a simple graph with n vertices.
Find the number of minimum spanning forest.

Editorial:
Solve individually for each connected component.
The answer is the product of methods for each connected component.
Since the question says that vertices have degree at most 2, each connected component of the graph is a chain or cycle.
A chain of length L consists of (L - 1) edges, so there is one spanning tree.
A period of length L consists of L edges, and one edge must be removed and left behind.
So there are L spatting trees in this cycle.
Determines the type of connected component by counting the number of edges and vertices on each connected component.
Time complexity is O(n).
