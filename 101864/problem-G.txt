Summary:
Given two integers F and G.
Find the different numbers of the three integer pairs that satisfy the following conditions.
F is the greatest common divisor of the three integers.
F is the product of three integers divided by G.

Editorial:

This task utilizes the prime subtraction algorithm, the inclusion exclusion principle and knowledge of number theory.
It solves in time complexity of O(log(n) * log(n)).
Let x = a/G, y = b/G, and z = c/G.
Then F(a,b,c) = a*b*c/G = x*G*y*G*z*G/G and x*y*z = F/G^2 = N.
If F is not a multiple of G^2, the answer is zero.
Since x*y*z = F/G^2 = N, x,y,z are divisors of N, and GCD(x,y,z) = 1.
By factoring N into prime numbers, you can use the inclusion exclusion principle to find the number of possible triple (x, y, z) pairs that satisfy the above condition.
