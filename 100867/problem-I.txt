 Contest: 100867, problem: Problem I. Irrationality
https://codeforces.com/gym/100867

Summary:
Given an irrational fraction with denominator √p1 + √p2 + ... + √pn and numerator 1.
Rationalize the denominator of this fraction.

Editorial:

The method of rationalizing the denominator is basic mathematical knowledge.
The basis for this problem is to keep the coefficients that grow when rationalizing, while keeping the fractions irreducible.
However, this is not a problem since Python generally supports calculation of large integer numbers.
The time complexity of rationalization is O(n * n).
