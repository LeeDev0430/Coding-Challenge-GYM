Summary:
Find the solution to the given 15 puzzles (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and many others).


Editorial:

This task is an implementation problem.
First, it must be determined whether a solution to the puzzle exists.
The fact is that swapping the places of two elements in an array does not change the evenness of the reverse conductance.
You can think of the 16 squares of the puzzle as one array, and the operation is a series of swaps as above.
Therefore, it is not difficult to know that a solution exists if the evenness of the inverse of the current state and that of the final state match.
There is no need to use a special algorithm, the important thing is to structure the condition and operation of the puzzle.
After that, of course, you can manipulate it however you think, just like the manual, but it's better to use a breadth-first search to find the solution with the shortest number of operations.
