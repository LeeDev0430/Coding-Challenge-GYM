https://codeforces.com/gym/100788

Summary:
Given two arrays A and B of length n and m respectively.
Among the subsegments of B, find the one that collectively matches A.

Editorial:
This problem is a problem that utilizes a hash algorithm.
We need to construct a collective hash of an array and allow elements to be added to or removed from it.
There are many ways to do this, but simply correspond the collection of integers to the sum of the square roots of each element.
Then it is easy to find the subsegment of array B that matches the hash value of array A.
Time complexity is O(n).
