 Contest: 101980, problem: Problem F. LinkedListâ€™s Bizarre Adventure

 Summary:
 A tree and two players are given.
Each competitor competes to obtain a chain for himself.
Each turn, a player removes one of the leaves and passes it to the opponent.
If the player who gets the chain first wins, who will win?

Editorial:

First of all, if the given tree is a chain, the first player wins.
Let's say it's not.
That is, there is at least one node whose degree is greater than 2.
Now consider the node whose degree is greater than 2 that is removed last.
If a player removes this node, it becomes a chain, so the opponent wins.
Therefore, we try not to remove the last node whose degree is greater than 2 as much as possible.
So this last node later becomes a star with node length 1.
At this time, the players reduce the order of the star by one, removing leaf points one by one.
Therefore, only the evenness of the size of the tree is relevant, and the shape of the tree is irrelevant.
If the size of the result tree is odd, the first player wins, otherwise the second player wins.
The time complexity is O(n).
