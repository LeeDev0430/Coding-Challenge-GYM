Contest: 100906, problem: Problem C. Nimble turtle

Summary: 
Given a grid where some cells are forbidden.
You are given three cell groups A, B and C.
Find the number of pairs (A[i], B[j], C[k]) that starting from cell A[i], you can only go right or down to cell C[k] without passing through prohibited cells and cell B[j].

Editorial:
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
Suppose we calculate the number of ways we can go from one cell to another between any two cells in A, B, C without going through the forbidden cells.
Then, the number of ways to go from a to c without passing through b is equal to the number of ways to get from a to c minus the number of ways to get from b to c multiplied by the number of ways to go from a to c.
With dynamic programming, for each cell, the number of ways from this cell to all other cells can be computed in O(n * n).
So the total time complexity is O(n * n * n).
