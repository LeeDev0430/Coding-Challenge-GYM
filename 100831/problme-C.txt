Summary:
Given a triple of pairs of integers n and m.
At this time, construct the sequence A as follows.
- The length of A is n.
- For every i, j, and k included in the triple, A[i], A[j], and A[k] must not all be the same.
Minimize the number of different elements of A.

Editorial:

This problem is a construction problem using state dynamic programming.
We use dynamic programming for a set of subsets of n integer sequences that we want to construct using state-dynamic programming.
First, for each set, it is possible to know whether it is okay to assign the same value to all numbers in this set.
The time complexity of this part is O((2 ^ n) * m).
For each subset, the dynamic programming value is optimized by multiplying the state value by 1 minus the set of elements with the same value in this set.
The time complexity of this part is O((3 ^ n)).
The total time complexity is O((2 ^ n) * m + 3 ^ n).
