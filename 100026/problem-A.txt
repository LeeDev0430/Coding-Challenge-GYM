Summary:
An undirected connected graph is given.
There are no edges involved in the two different simple circular paths.
Find the number of ways to divide all vertices into groups according to the following condition.
- Every vertex belongs to exactly one group.
- Each group has no vertices that are adjacent to each other.


Editorial:

This task utilizes knowledge of combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming.
This can be done in a time complexity of O(n * n * n).
The number of ways to fit n elements into non interacting groups is a Stirling number of the first kind, widely known in combinatorial mathematics.
The time complexity of finding the Stirling number is O(n * n).
We can use depth first search to break the entire graph into simple recursive paths.
Using dynamic programming, you can first calculate the number of ways to split into i groups in a circular path.
Each group split in one circular path can independently merge with groups split in another path.
It is also multiplied as an independent trial.
Dynamic programming is expanded to the entire graph by using the Stirling number for the groups divided in each circular path.
The time complexity of this part is O(n * n * n).
