Contest: 100100, problem: Task D: Inserting Key Values
https://codeforces.com/gym/100100

Summary:
There are arrays that are considered infinite in length.
Each element of the array is initially 0.
Find the array after performing n operations to insert a specific value at a specific location.

Editorial:

This problem can be solved by using the Treap (Random value splay tree) algorithm.
The operation of inserting an arbitrary value at an arbitrary position can be performed with a time complexity of log(n).
The time complexity is O(n * log(n)).
