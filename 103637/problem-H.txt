Summary:
2xn teams from m countries competive.
Teams are randomly matched into n pairs.
We know the expected value of the number of pairs in which teams competive in the same country.
Find a possible country distribution of teams which satisfy above condition.

Editorial:
It is safe to say that x/y is an irreducible fraction.
Let C(a, b) be the number of combinations from a to b.
Then the total number of matching methods is C(2 * n, n) * (n!).
Here, C(2 * n, n) is the number of ways to divide 2 * n teams into two classes, and (n!) is the number of ways to match the divided teams.
Suppose a country has x teams.
Then, the number of ways that two teams in this country are matched is C(x, 2) * 2 * C(2 * n - 2, n - 1) * ((n - 1)!).
Here, C(x, 2) * 2 is the number of ways to select two teams from this country and arrange them to match each other.
C(2 * n - 2, n - 1) is the number of ways to match the remaining n - 2 teams.
So the expected value x / y of the problem is Sum of [C(x, 2) * 2 * C(2 * n - 2, n - 1) * ((n - 1)!)] / [C(2 * n , n) * (n!) ], and simply Sum of C(x, 2) / (2 * n - 1).
Since 2 * n - 1 is odd, y must be odd.
So we just set n and x such that the Sum of C(x, 2) is (2*n - 1) * x / y.
2 * n - 1 can be set as a multiple of y.
As you can easily see, the Sum of C(x, 2) can take all values below C(n, 2).
Time complexity is O(n).
