Summary:
Given a matrix of shape n*m, the numbers from 1 to n*m are placed sequentially.
Now the operations are given sequentially, starting with the 2 * 2 sub-matrix in the upper left corner.
Every operation rotates the 2 * 2 matrix right or left or does not rotate.
When this operation sequence is repeated s times, find the frequency of the elements appearing in the upper left corner of the 2 * 2 submatrix each time the operation is executed.

Editorial:
This task is solved in O(n * m * log(S)) time complexity by utilizing permutation fast power algorithm and implementation.
If you perform one manipulation sequence, you can know the permutation of the moved position for the elements of the entire matrix.
To find the S square of this permutation, we use the fast power algorithm.
The permutation is performed by attaching the frequency together.
The frequencies are summed up.
The complexity of multiplying two permutations is O(n * m).
