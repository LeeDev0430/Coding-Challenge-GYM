Summary:
Given a integer x, create a matrix of shape n * m, containing x nice slices.
Here, a good slice is a 1*x or x*1 shape and the inner sequence is a monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing sequence.


Editorial:
This problem is a structural problem and there are various approaches to it, and I used the following approach.
A 1D strip can be divided into chains of monotonic segments.
This allows us to generate all values of X' by doing a simple dp.
You can create 1D strips of size N.
Let SN represent the set of values that can be produced using a 1D strip of size N.
You want to retrieve N values from SM that sum to H.
Since the set of SMs contains almost all possible values, intuitively, if we choose the largest value in SM that does not exceed the current target value of H each time, after M iterations we will probably have an answer.
In practice, this greedy approach works very well and you can use this idea for a full solution.
Time complexity is O(n).
