Summary: 
There are two squares of size 10^18 * 10^18 in a plane.
Each cell in every square has a +1 or -1.
There are two types of operations:
1. Multiply all numbers in a row by -1.
2. Multiply all numbers in the column by -1.
The numbers in the j - column of the i - row of the first square are ai, j and the second square is bi, j.
Initially, there is no information about the numerical values within the square.
In each query, give the values x ,y, a(x,y), b(x,y) (values not obtained before) and find whether the first square can be converted to the second square.

Editorial:

It doesn't matter how many times you run the operation for each row or column.
What matters is whether it's odd or even.
So we assign a boolean to each row and each column so that row number i's boolean is ri and column j's boolean is cj.
The others are the same as 2-sat except that the graph in this problem is undirected.
For each query, if ax, y = bx, y then add an edge between rx and cy and between ¬rx and ¬cy.
Otherwise, add an edge between ¬rx and cy and an edge between ¬cy and rx.
You can use disjoint sets with arrays or vectors, and at each step the answer will be 'YES' if booleans such as x and ¬x are in the same component.
The time complexity is O(N * log(N)).
