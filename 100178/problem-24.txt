Summary:
A plane is given n non-intersecting circles and m integer-valued points.
Now, we're going to use all the dots to gather them together.
However, for each given circle, the cost of passing the boundary of this point was given.
And each point has a cost equal to the value of the integer value assigned to the point multiplied by the cost of passing through the circle.
Find the minimum cost to combine the given points into one point.

Editorial:
This problem can be solved using geometry and depth-first search.
First of all, since the circles do not intersect, any two circles are separated from each other or contain each other.
For each circle, considering the circles directly contained in this circle as children, all the given circles form a graph of a tree.
In this case, the cost of passing each edge is given.
Therefore, we just need to calculate the cost of moving points to any node in this tree.
This is a classic tree dynamic programming problem and will not be discussed further.
The time complexity is O(n \* m).
