Summary:
There is a city modeled as a grid of shape n*m.
At the vertices of this grid are the museums modeled as points.
Now, a horizontal straight road from west to east and roads heading north and south from this road must be additionally built so that all museums can be visited.
At this time, find the minimum value of the travel distance when visiting museums from the west end to the east end.

Editorial:
This problem is a simple dynamic planning algorithm problem.
Let's say that none of the roads we built go past the museum.
If there are two museums closest to the north and south of the road, there is no dot on the straight line between them.
At this time, if the road is moved north or south by 1, the total path length increases or decreases at equal intervals.
Thus, a road that minimizes the length of the route may be said to pass at least one museum.
At this time, when the museums are sorted in relation to the y value and the road passing through each museum is constructed using the dynamic programming method, the total path length can be obtained.
Time complexity is O(n * log(n))
