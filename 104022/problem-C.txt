Summary:
A plane is given n points.
Find all good points that satisfy the following conditions.
- A good point is one of the given n points.
- A circle that has an origin and a good point at both ends of its diameter contains no other good points.

Editorial:

This test utilizes a sorting algorithm and the Pythagorean theorem.
The time complexity of O(n * log(n)) is required using the sorting algorithm and the Pythagorean theorem.
A circle drawn from a point whose norm is small to two points does not include the other point.
So it's okay to start with points with small norm and add them to good groups.
When adding a point, consider whether there is no good point already added to the drawn circle from this point.
Let's look at the two good points on both ends that have the closest angle to this point.
If only these two points lie outside the circle you drew from the newly added points, you know that the other good points are also outside this circle.
(A point lies outside the circle with diameters of the two points) is both necessary and sufficient (the angle from this point to the other two points is an acute angle).
Whether the angles of the three points are acute can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
