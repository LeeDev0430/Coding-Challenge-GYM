Summary:
This problem is an interactive problem and can be solved using constructive algorithms.
All you need to do is find a path cycle through which the snake passes through all the cells regardless of the position of the apple.
If n or m is even, there is a Hamiltonian period through all cells in the field.
Between two adjacent eaten apples, the snake takes no more than n * m steps.
Therefore, the total number of steps will not exceed 10000.
If n and m are both odd, one corner cell can be cut out of the field, and a Hamiltonian cycle can be constructed over it.
The only difference is if the apples are in the far corner cage.
In this case, just drive when the snake's head passes this corner.
Time complexity is O(n * n * n).

Editorial:
This problem is an interactive problem and can be solved using structural algorithms.
All you have to do is find a circular path for the snake to go through all the cells of the grid, regardless of where the apple is.
If n or m is even, there is a Hamiltonian path through all cells in the field.
It takes no more than n*m steps to eat a new apple.
Therefore, the total number of steps will not exceed 10000.
If n and m are both odd, one corner cell can be cut out of the field, and a Hamiltonian period can be constructed over it.
The only difference is whether the apples are in the far corner cage.
In this case, just drive when the snake's head passes this corner.
