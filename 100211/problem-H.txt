Summary:
Groups of at most 4 people are given.
Each group has a value.
Barry these people into 9 seats of 4 to get the maximum total satisfaction.
Total satisfaction is the sum of each person's satisfaction.
The satisfaction value of each person is the number of people in the same group in the same seat multiplied by the value of the group he belongs to.


Editorial:
This task utilizes brute force and depth first search methods.
Using the above two algorithms, it is solved in time complexity O(C(36, 4) * n).
You can see that there is no need to put two groups of people of size 3 and above into a pair of seats.
If so, you can see that increasing one group to three is a better solution.
Also, less than 2 people in a group can be ignored as their satisfaction level is 0.
From the above conditions, each group must place 3 or more people in one seat set or 2 people in one seat set.
And 1 person left after deployment is ignored.
In all of these cases, the sum is about C(36, 4).
All of these placement methods can be obtained by brute forcing using depth first search.
